= Make It Real

== Introduction

Make It Real is a cloud based service,
where you can upload a model you want 3D printed,
or an idea of what you need. If you send a model
we print it for you and ship to you directly.
If you sent an idea, we make you a model based
on that, while asking you further questions about your needs,
and then send it to you. You can send your 3D model in .stl or in .step file format.

== The goal

The goal is to create an application that allows users to live out their creativity with 3D printable designs. If they don't want or don't have the resources to buy a 3D printer, we can give you a much cheaper solution to make your ideas come to life.
